           <h2>Menu</h2>
           <p>Design and human behavior are like bread and butter; they are always tendered together. The menu card is like an aperitif of the brand, it is the first step of interaction with the customers and one does not want to spoil that!</p>
           <br>
           <p><b>Combine the Colour</b>
           Select such a colour for your menu that goes with the persona of your brand. Study well the psychology of each shade and how it influences a person’s feelings. For instance, Red is an active colour and would probably make you feel even more hungry and that’s why big brands like McDonald’s and Burger King have dominant shades of red. The colour Green gives you a belief that the food is fresh and juicy while Orange gives your tummy an appetite. Yellow is a bright and cheerful colour which will help you grab a lot of attention.

           <b>The Golden Triangle of Positioning</b>
           <p>Studies suggest that our eyes see the things in the center first, then at the top right corner and then at the top left. This intangible movement of eyes is called as the golden triangle. Restaurant menu engineers say that the most profitable dishes should be listed here, it does not necessarily have to be the most expensive ones, just the dishes that bring you the highest profit. So make sure you do your food cost management and list your dishes cleverly

                   <h2><u>Authenticity</u></h2>
                   <p>
                   <i>You get a very clear picture as to how locals really are when they are relaxed and when they socialize. So, a coffee shop is a good place to observe that because they are themselves when they sit there.</i>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   ‘Authentic’ places, meals and items are offered to tourists everywhere. Often, it is hard to distinguish what is really authentic and what is just a “tourist trap”. Local cafés may bring authentic experiences on several levels, and tourists are beginning to become aware of that. Cafés represent local culture and local people. The menu may be based on what locals like to eat and drink, the interior may be decorated typically for that nation and the customers may, by their behaviour, language and fashion, provide an understanding of what the local population is like. And so, just by sitting at a table and looking around, tourists can get a very good idea of what the area, city or maybe the whole country is like.

                   <h2><u>Connection</u></h2>
                   <p>
                   <i>It is a place where you meet people. You connect, just by a smile or by a look. You don’t necessarily have to talk. We all know cafés are social places. Tourists may visit cafés not only to chat with friends they are travelling with but also to connect with other people around them.</i>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   A café is a unique place where locals and tourists meet, without getting in each other's way (in most of the cases). Does the layout of your café support social interaction? Does it have a shared table?
                   If yes, what is the purpose of it there? Maybe next time you can direct a tourist to a shared table and see how they take advantage of it.
                   It is more of a neutral zone, a place of leisure for everyone. Especially for people travelling on their own, they may see cafés as safe places where they can seek social interaction with both other customers and the baristas. I remember the last time—and the first time—I travelled on my own I really appreciated the opportunity to sit at a shared table. Not necessarily to converse with a stranger, but just to feel more part of the crowd.

                   <h2><u>Recommendations</u></h2>
                   <p>
                   <i>I get this question every day “where should I go after this?”. As a barista, if you don’t have a couple of things to recommend you should probably learn some because it’s very useful.</i> 
                   <br>
                   <br>I have witnessed a barista or another customer give a tourist recommendations on many occasions. Local people represent the city, therefore are seen as trustworthy sources of information. Tourist information offices may provide quite general/mainstream advice on what to do and where to go in that particular city. Getting a recommendation from a local in a friendly and casual atmosphere is much more engaging for tourists. That is why it is getting common for tourists to approach the barista with questions about a great restaurant nearby, places to visit, or fun activities in the city.What do you think really stands out in your city? What places really represent the atmosphere and vibe of the town? Try to prepare a couple of recommendations in advance so your advice is thought through. You can definitely influence someone’s stay in your town.

                   <h2><u>Attraction/Experience</u></h2>
                   <p>
                   <i>A lot of the time coffee shops tend to create very interesting interiors. When it comes to furnishing, choice of dishes, music. In these speciality cafés, everything is thought through, so I think they are always very special and inspirational.</i>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   If you have cafés as the only points of interest when visiting a city, then you really are a coffee enthusiast! Most of us visit cafés when exploring a city, however, for some this may be almost akin to visiting a museum or major tourist attraction—and this can also apply to non-coffee people (to my surprise). Many people choose in advance where to go for a coffee, but when I spoke to people about visiting these cafes, I found out that they took different memories away from the experience. There was a story about the cup, about colours of the furniture, about the atmosphere, or about the people around.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Stories about the coffee itself often came from baristas only. And so, the café may be an attraction where different people find their “thing”. In most cases though, the memory that the visitors kept from that place was bound to something else than coffee, it surpassed the main reason the person went there in the first place—the coffee itself. Speaking of memories and attractions— merchandise sold in cafés (roasted coffee, cups, t-shirts etc.) may serve as a souvenir the same way as a miniature Eiffel tower, maybe even better! Do you have such goods in your shop? When a café becomes a destination and tourists are wandering the streets to find it, it can be thought of as a tourist attraction in its own right.
