           <h2>About Café-72</h2>
           <p>Café-72 in its previous version back in 2011 was the first coworking cafe in Nairobi Central Region. Our urban / industrial designed café was the hub for all entrepreneurs, creative freelancers and senior management executives of Nairobi Central Region. We had to close the venue due to building being sold. We are looking forward to securing a bigger and better space to re-establish Café-72. Since late 2016 , we have morphed into  an art Café in the historical area of Nairobi Central Region, located in Lavington.
           <br>
           <br>
          Café-72 was previously known as Dhusto.Inc, which was first opened 2011 and properly got recognition from 2012 to late 2013. Newly known as
          Café-72 later in 2015, runs its operations from the courtyard of the Lavington Mall in one of the most attractive areas of the Nairobi Central Region. Our Café provides guests with an ideal serene  spaces  for quiet work, refreshing drinks and food or just to sit and read.

           Café-72 in partnership with the UEP hosts to various company’s corporate events, training, ideation seminars and workshops. Many of these activities can be combined with a heritage tour and other interesting artistic workshops. Menu is customisable with either buffet or canapés along with free flowing freshly brewed coffees, teas and natural soft drinks. We are also very comfortable with suggestions of various forms of food and cuisines from different countries to show our diversity.
